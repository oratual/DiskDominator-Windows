# Duplicates Module Implementation

## Overview

The Duplicates module for DiskDominator has been fully implemented with advanced features for detecting and managing duplicate files across multiple disks.

## Backend Implementation (Rust)

### 1. **duplicate_commands.rs**
Located at: `src-tauri/src/commands/duplicate_commands.rs`

#### Key Features:
- **Multiple Detection Methods**:
  - Hash-based (SHA-256) - Most accurate, compares file content
  - Name-based - Quick search by filename
  - Size-based - Groups files by size
  - Name & Size - Combination approach

- **Commands Implemented**:
  - `find_duplicates_advanced` - Main duplicate detection with options
  - `get_duplicate_groups` - Returns groups with summary statistics
  - `delete_duplicates_batch` - Batch deletion with safety checks
  - `smart_select_duplicates` - AI-powered selection strategies
  - `preview_duplicate` - File preview support

- **Smart Selection Strategies**:
  - Keep Newest - Retains files with most recent modification
  - Keep Oldest - Preserves original files
  - Keep in Organized - Prioritizes files in organized folders
  - AI Suggestion - Placeholder for future AI integration

### 2. **Data Structures**
```rust
pub struct DuplicateGroup {
    pub id: String,
    pub hash: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub file_type: String,
    pub total_size: u64,
    pub recoverable_size: u64,
    pub copies: Vec<DuplicateCopy>,
}
```

## Frontend Implementation (React/TypeScript)

### 1. **Hooks**

#### `use-duplicates-finder.ts`
- Main hook for duplicate detection
- Supports both advanced and simple detection modes
- Handles batch deletion operations
- Provides formatting utilities

#### `useDuplicateSelection.ts`
- Manages selection state across duplicate groups
- Smart selection application
- Selection statistics calculation
- Bulk operations support

#### `useDuplicatePreview.ts`
- File preview loading
- Side-by-side comparison
- File explorer integration
- Default app opening

### 2. **UI Components**

#### `duplicates-view.tsx`
Enhanced with:
- **Detection Method Selector**: Choose between hash, name, size, or combined detection
- **Smart Selection UI**: Apply intelligent selection strategies
- **Advanced Filters**: Minimum file size, disk selection
- **Real-time Statistics**: Space recoverable, items selected
- **Batch Operations**: Delete multiple files with confirmation
- **File Actions**: Preview, open in explorer, mark for keeping/deletion
- **Empty State**: Clear CTA when no duplicates found
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## Usage Guide

### Finding Duplicates

1. **Select Disks**: Choose which disks to scan
2. **Choose Detection Method**:
   - Hash (most accurate, slower)
   - Name (quick, may have false positives)
   - Size (groups by size only)
   - Name & Size (balanced approach)
3. **Apply Filters**: Set minimum file size if needed
4. **Click "Buscar duplicados"**

### Managing Duplicates

1. **Review Groups**: Expand each group to see all copies
2. **Manual Selection**: Click keep/delete buttons on individual files
3. **Smart Selection**: Apply automated selection strategies
4. **Batch Delete**: Review selections and confirm deletion

### API Integration

```typescript
// Find duplicates with options
const { duplicates, summary } = await findDuplicates({
  disks: ['C', 'D'],
  detection_method: 'hash',
  min_size: 1024 * 1024, // 1MB
});

// Apply smart selection
await applySmartSelection('keep-newest');

// Delete selected files
const result = await deleteDuplicatesBatch(selectedFileIds);
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Hashing**: 
   - Quick hash (first/last MB) for initial grouping
   - Full hash only for candidates

2. **Async Operations**:
   - Non-blocking file operations
   - Progress tracking support

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Stream-based file reading
   - Pagination support for large result sets

## Security Features

1. **Safety Checks**:
   - Ensures at least one copy remains
   - Move to trash option (default)
   - Confirmation dialogs

2. **Error Recovery**:
   - Failed deletions reported separately
   - Rollback capability
   - Detailed error messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI Integration**:
   - Content-aware duplicate detection
   - Smart organization suggestions
   - Pattern learning from user choices

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Folder duplicate detection
   - Similar file detection (fuzzy matching)
   - Duplicate prevention monitoring

3. **Performance**:
   - Parallel hashing
   - Incremental scanning
   - Result caching

## Testing

Run duplicate detection tests:
```bash
# In the Tauri directory
cargo test duplicate

# Frontend tests
npm test -- duplicates
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No duplicates found"**
   - Ensure disks are scanned first
   - Check detection method settings
   - Verify minimum file size filter

2. **Slow performance**
   - Use name/size detection for quick results
   - Consider filtering by file size
   - Scan specific directories instead of entire disks

3. **Delete failures**
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure files aren't in use
   - Verify disk space for trash operations
